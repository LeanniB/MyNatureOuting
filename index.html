<!-- Thanks for learning about sustainability at Pitt. , where you'll use code to process and share your experiences with others. While you are exploring sustainable design, gather pictures and data you'll use in this document.

To get started making this document, you'll need to download the zip file from GitHub. Go ahead and put these files in a secure folder where you can find them and organize assets like files and images. You'll also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "CodePad" on Chromebooks. Open the index.html document in the text editor and we can get started building our own webpage.-->

<!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system?-->

<!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Then you'll need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences-->

    <p>Plant2Plate is a produce garden located on Univerity of Pittsbrugh campus. It is an initatice to connect the farm, the kitchen and the community through hands-on agricultural. Participants learn about planting and harvesting crops along with produce nutritional value. The Fresh produce grown is used within campus dining halls and donated to near by shelters. Urban gardens contibute to capturing carbon, reducing food miles and creating a sense of connection to the land. Other communities could replicate this Plant2Plate model. Acess to fresh produce can enchance food security along all while providing learning experiences. The success of this mission lies in its ability to integrate education, community and sustainability.  </p>

      <p style="color:black"><p> The bike care is a student-run bike shop located on univerity campus that provides a space for community members to access repair resources and learn about bike maintenance. By providing free bike maintenacne support, bike caves encourage people to use bicycles as an alternative to cars. While promoting the use of bikes, it helps reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions thus contributing to a healthier and more active community. If cities invest in bike lines and other cycling infrasturture, it would not only improve cycling conditions but also help the cycling community thive, which would advance the need for more Bike Caves.  </p></p>

<!-- Modal 2-->
<div id="myModal2" class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <span class="close">&times;</span>
    <p style="color:black"><p> This bee house is a wooden structure that allowes for nesting sites within a garden that provides food, shelter and a safesapce for pollinators to thrive. The low-mainteance native plants that bloom within the garden attracts bees so that they can lay eggs in the small cavities in the bee house that gives protection. Having pollinator gardens provide bees a safe haven to raise their young and find food. These spaces faciliate essential pollination than enchances local ecosystems by promoting biodiveristy. Biodiverse ecosystems absorb emmissions and heat, reducing climate impact and improves air quality by filtering pollutants. A way to expand this idea is to raise awareness about the bee species along with their role and encourage other locations to create similar pollinator - friendly spaces.    </p></p>

<!-- Modal 3-->

    <span class="close">&times;</span>
    <p style="color:black"><p>A Rain Garden captures and manages stormwater runoff from surfaces to infiltrate into the soil. The plants and soil within the rain garden filter pollutants preventing them from eaching rivers, lakes and oceans. The removal of pollutants improves the over all quality of water. It reduces flooding in city areas such as strees and parking lots allowing rainwater to be absorbed by the ground instead of sewers. These gardens also provide food and shelter for butterflies, songbirds and other wildlife. Their presence engances biodiverity. They are both cost-effective and beautiful. The community can learn to understand the benefits of rain gardens by thinking of all the ways it does not only protect the infrastructure of land but the cleanliness of their surrounding bodies of water. The collaboration with community memebers that like hand-on nature work can help promote rain gardens within cities.</p></p>
